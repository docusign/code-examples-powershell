# PowerShell Launcher Code Examples

### GitHub repo: [code-examples-powershell](./README.md)

This GitHub repo includes code examples for the DocuSign Admin API, Click API, eSignature REST API, ID Evidence API, Monitor API, Notary API, and Rooms API. To switch between API code examples, select the desired option from the menu when prompted.


## Introduction

This repo includes a PowerShell command-line application that supports the following authentication workflows:

* Authentication with DocuSign via [Authorization Code Grant](https://developers.docusign.com/platform/auth/authcode).
When the token expires, the user is asked to re-authenticate. The refresh token is not used.

* Authentication with DocuSign via [JSON Web Token (JWT) Grant](https://developers.docusign.com/platform/auth/jwt/).
When the token expires, it updates automatically.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
**Note:** If you downloaded this code using [Quickstart](https://developers.docusign.com/docs/esign-rest-api/quickstart/) from the DocuSign Developer Center, skip items 1 and 2 as they were automatically performed for you.

1. A free [DocuSign developer account](https://go.docusign.com/o/sandbox/); create one if you don't already have one.
1. A DocuSign app and integration key that is configured for authentication to use either [Authorization Code Grant](https://developers.docusign.com/platform/auth/authcode/) or [JWT Grant](https://developers.docusign.com/platform/auth/jwt/).

   This [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiRI4fe5HgM) demonstrates how to obtain an integration key.  

   To use [Authorization Code Grant](https://developers.docusign.com/platform/auth/authcode/), you will need an integration key and a secret key. See [Installation steps](#installation-steps) for details.  

   To use [JWT Grant](https://developers.docusign.com/platform/auth/jwt/), you will need an integration key, an RSA key pair, and the User ID GUID of the impersonated user. See [Installation steps for JWT Grant authentication](#installation-steps-for-jwt-grant-authentication) for details.  

   For both authentication flows:  
   
   If you use this launcher on your own workstation, the integration key must include a redirect URI of  

   http://localhost:8080/authorization-code/callback  

   If you host this launcher on a remote web server, set your redirect URI as   
   
   {base_url}/authorization-code/callback   
   
   where {base_url} is the URL for the web app.  
   
1. PowerShell 5 or later
1. PowerShell script files (PS1) downloaded from the internet that are not digitally signed are considered a security risk. By default, PowerShell blocks execution of such scripts. To bypass this limitation, you will need to run the following command at the Windows PowerShell command line: `Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass`  
   After executing this command, you can run the downloaded PowerShell script.  
   

### Installation steps
**Note:** If you downloaded this code using [Quickstart](https://developers.docusign.com/docs/esign-rest-api/quickstart/) from the DocuSign Developer Center, skip step 3 as it was automatically performed for you.
