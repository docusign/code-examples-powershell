## Installation

Download or clone this repository to your workstation

## Collect your Integration information

* Create a [DocuSign developer account](https://account-d.docusign.com/#/username) if you have not yet done so.
* Once you have a DocuSign account created, make a new [**integration key**](https://admindemo.docusign.com/api-integrator-key).
* Add in the following **redirect uri** `http://localhost:8080/authorization-code/callback`
* Find your **API Account Id:** on the same page you used to setup your [**integration key**](https://admindemo.docusign.com/api-integrator-key).
* Update `config/settings.json` with the credentials from DocuSign developer account:
  * `IMPERSONATION_USER_GUID` = API Account ID
  * `INTEGRATION_KEY_JWT` = Integration Key
  * `INTEGRATION_KEY_AUTH_CODE` = Integration Key
  * `SECRET_KEY` = Secret Key
  * `GATEWAY_ACCOUNT_ID``GATEWAY_ACCOUNT_ID` = Account ID
* **Signer name and email:** Remember to try the DocuSign signing ceremony using both a mobile phone and a regular
  email client.


## JWT Authentication

* create an RSA KeyPair on your **integration key** and copy the **private_key** into the file `config/private.key` and save it. Use JWT authentication if you intend to run a system account integration or to impersonate a different user.
* OPTIONAL: If you intend to use JWT grant authentication, set **Impersonation_user_guid** by using your own **user_account_id** found on the same page used to set your [**integration key**](https://admindemo.docusign.com/api-integrator-key). 


## OAuth Details

This launcher is a collection of powershell scripts with an included http listener script.  The listener script works on **port 8080** in order to receive the redirect callback from successful authorization with DocuSign servers that include the Authorization code or an access token in the response payload. Confirm that port 8080 is not in use by other applications so that the OAuth mechanism functions properly.  

These OAuth scripts are integrated into the launcher and hardcode the location for the RSA private key in the case of the JWT php scripts.  

Do not delete or change the name of the private.key file located in the config directory as this will cause problems with jwt authentication. 

## Running the examples
You can see each of the various examples in action by running `powershell launcher.ps1` and pressing the number six to get to the option to edit your form data. 

Log in to your DocuSign account using either Authorization Code Grant or using JWT to gain an OAuth token. From there, you can pick the number that corresponds to a setting or feature you wish to try out. 

If you make a mistake, simply run the settings option again. Each code example is a standalone file, but can be reached using the launcher.ps1 file.

Use the powershell terminal to run the examples. 

The examples have been tested on Windows but can conceivably be used with MacOS and Linux systems.

The source files for each example are located in the `/examples` directory.


### Payments code example
To use the payments code example, first create a test payments gateway in your account.
Follow the instructions in the
[PAYMENTS_INSTALLATION.md](https://github.com/docusign/code-examples-powershell/blob/master/PAYMENTS_INSTALLATION.md)
file.

Then add the payment gateway id to the code example file.
